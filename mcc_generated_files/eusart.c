  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the EUSART driver using MPLAB� Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for EUSART.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB� Code Configurator - v2.25.2
        Device            :  PIC16F1825
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v2.35 or v3.00
